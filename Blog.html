		<ul> <h5>Assignment 0 Reflection:</h5>
			<ul>
				<p>Overall, I felt really good about this first (zeroth?) assignment. It was a good refresher for basic HTML. I already knew most of what to do, though I did have to Google the br and em tags to remember them. 
				I also looked up the img tag for syntax and options. Though I haven't used Github much in the past, it turns out it's very easy to use and navigate! I look forward to the coming assignments, because while I can 
				make a simple HTML page, and easily look up anything I don't know, I know nothing about Javascript or CSS! It's going to be fun learning something new.</p>
